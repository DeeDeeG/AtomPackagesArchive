# AtomPackagesArchive

This is a CLI application that can allow you to backup all exisitng packages from
Atom.io

There are `9,241` packages or `416` pages paginated at `30` items of content.

Obviously I am using this to keep an archive myself. But HIGHLY recommend anyone else that has
some disk space to spare to also archive this data. We don't want one possible failure causing this data to be lost.
